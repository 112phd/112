INTRODUCTION
'Is this a memory thing? (referring to a laboratory task) didn't they tell
you I can't do this stuff ? didn't they tell you I don't have a memory 7'
(a learning disabled 11-year old)
'I think the improvement of language is due to some ability
personal ability In my case, I have no personal ability So I think it will
take a long time
there is no good way to speed up my learning (a
Japanese business man)
'I'm watching my English by learning more vocabulary because
without words—English consists of words and I think I should learn
more In level 9,1 was really studying English I felt relaxed I was doing
something I was learning words' (a Yugoslavian undergraduate)
These statements, excerpted from learner accounts,2 suggest that learners of
different ages and varying in learning proficiency will have acquired some
knowledge about learning, which influences their approach to learning and
the expectations they hold about the outcome of their efforts It is this
knowledge about learning, referred to as metacognitive knowledge, that is the
focus of this article
Foreign and second language educators involved in learner training, l e
providing instruction in the use of cognitive strategies or the skills for selfdirected language learning, agree that metacognitive knowledge should also
be a component of these programs (eg Holec 1981, 1990, 1994, Wenden
1986, 1987a, 1991, 1995, Dickinson 1987, Horwitz 1987, 1988, Casanave

Dating back to the early 80s, the FL/SL bterature on learner strategies and on
self-directed language learning documents an ongoing recognition of the need
to help language learners reflect upon and refine their bebefs and knowledge
about learning, I e their metacognitive knowledge To date, however, this
literature has not been explicit about the function of this knowledge in
language learning This article reviews selected theoretical and research
literature on metacogmtion to address this lack It argues that insights provided
by the review can enhance our understanding of those approaches to second
language acquisition which assign an active role to the learner, and concludes
witha consideration of practical impbcations for foreign and second language
instruction

516 METACOGNITIVE KNOWLEDGE AND LANGUAGE LEARNING

NATURE OF METACOGNITIVE KNOWLEDGE
Very simply, metacognitive knowledge refers to knowledge about learning A
more specific understanding of the nature of this knowledge, however,
requires a consideration of the following its defining characteristics, the
categones which distinguish one kind of metacognitive knowledge from
another, and the distinction between metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive strategies

Defining characteristics of metacognitive knowledge
Metacognitive knowledge is the relatively stable information human thinkers
have about their own cognitive processes and those of others (Flavell and
Wellman 1977), it is a specialized portion of their knowledge base {Flavell
1979) acquired formally or informally, deliberately or incidentally This
knowledge is statable—learners can become conscious of and articulate what
they know Brown et al (1983) distinguish between stable knowledge already
stored in long term memory and transient knowledge, I e insights that
emerge during the learning process While Flavell and Wellman (1977)
charactenze it as late developing, in fact, the cognitive literature has
documented knowledge and beliefs held by learners of all ages from preschoolers (eg Kreutzer, Leonard, Flavell, as cited in Brown et al 1983) to
elementary and secondary school children (e g Pans and Byrnes 1989, Chinn
and Brewer 1993) and college and university students (e g Schommer 1990)
In the FL/SL literature, metacognitive knowledge is also referred to as
learner beliefs (Horwitz 1987), learners' naive psychology of learning
(Wenden 1987), learner representations (Holec 1987, Gremmo and Riley
1995), each of these terms pointing to other defining characteristics of this
knowledge

and O'Malley 1994, Chamot 1995, Rubin 1995, Gremmo and Riley 1995,
Victon and Lockart 1995, Benson 1996, Riley 1996, Sinclair 1996) However,
until now there has been no explicit, theoretically-based discussion of the
function of metacognitive knowledge in language learning This article
intends to address this lack First, it briefly clarifies what is intended by. the
term metacognitive knowledge Next, it reviews selected theoretical and
research literature on metacognition to determine how this knowledge comes
into play in the self-direction of learning, namely planning and evaluating,
task analysis (a component of planning), monitoring, and the transfer of
learning (a component of both planning and monitoring^ This is followed by
a discussion of how insights from the review can enhance our understanding
of those approaches to second language acquisition which assign an active
role to the learner The conclusion considers the practical implications of the
review for foreign and second language instruction

Learner beliefs

Learner representations
The term learner representations comes from constructivist psychology and
points to the fact that metacognitive knowledge is not an exact replica of
experience but encoded in long-term memory in the manner' in which it is
perceived by a learner It vanes depending on the type and extent of the
analysis that was performed (Craik as cited in Cavanaugh and Perlmutter
1982) and on whether it is generalized or specific (Pans and Byrnes 1989,
Bialystok 1994)

Naive psychology of learning
A learner's naive psychology of learning is linked to another constfuctivist
notion, l e of the child as theonst (Pans and Byrnes 1989/Karmiloff, Smith,
and Inhelder 1974/75, Brown et al 1983) It acknowledges that learners
generate their own hypotheses about factors that contnbute to learning and
that these notions are not arbitrary Learners make some' attempt to validate
them and the resulting insights are linked to one another in a logical fashion
Together these terms point to the following charactenstics of metacognitive
knowledge and beliefs
(1) a part of a learner's store of acquired knowledge
(2) relatively stable and statable
(3) early developing
(4) a system of related ideas
(5) an abstract representation of a learner's expenence
A final charactenstic distinguishes beliefs from metacognitive knowledge, i e
their value-relatedness and idiosyncratic nature, suggesting that beliefs would
be held more tenaciously than knowledge 5

There is no clear consensus on the distinctions between knowledge and
beliefs, although the choice of one term instead of the other is a tacit
recognition that there is' a difference 3 Generally, knowledge is viewed as
factual, objective information, acquired through formal learning (Alexander
and Dochy 1995), and, probably, representative of the body of knowledge that
constitutes a particular discipline of study On the other hand, beliefs are
viewed as individual subjective understandings, idiosyncratic truths, which
are often value related and characterized by a commitment not present in
knowledge (Alexander and Dochy 1995) 4 Flavell (1987) suggests that beliefs
about learning are a component of metacognitive knowledge, a view shared
by Alexander and Dochy (1994)

518 METACOGNITIVE KNOWLEDGE AND LANGUAGE LEARNING

Categories for classifying metacognitive knowledge

Downloaded from http://applij.oxfordjournals.org/ at Pennsylvania State University on March 4, 2016

Metacogmtive knowledge has been classified according to whether it focuses
on the learner, the learning task or the process of learning Flavell (1979,
1981, 1981a) refers to these three categories as person, task and strategic
knowledge, and though these distinctions are not strictly adhered to by all,
the vanety of knowledge types referred to in the cognitive and FL/SL
literature can usually be categorized as one or the other
Person knowledge is general knowledge learners have acquired about human
factors that facilitate or inhibit learning The cognitive and affective vanables
hypothesized as influencing language acquisition in SLA research are
examples of such factors, e g age, language aptitude, motivation
(see
Ellis 1986 and Brown 1987 for a review of this research, and Horwitz 1987,
1988 and Victon 1995 for research which documents FL/SL learners' beliefs
about several of these factors) In addition, person knowledge includes specific
knowledge learners have acquired about how the above factors apply in their
expenence The Japanese business man, referred to earlier, believed he did
not have the personal ability necessary for language learning, the learning
disabled child believed that he did not have a memory Learners may also
have acquired (person) knowledge about their proficiency in a given area,
based on assessments they have made or received about their skills Language
learners, for example, will have some notion of how well they read, write,
how much grammar they know
Further, person knowledge includes
what learners believe about their effectiveness as learners in general, I e selfefficacy beliefs about their ability to mobilize and manage the resources
necessary to leam and to sustain the effort (see Cotterall 1995, Lloyd,
Mikulecky and Huang 1997 for research on self-efficacy beliefs of language
learners) Finally, person knowledge refers to beliefs about their ability to
achieve specific learning goals, such as the knowledge and/or skills they need
to write in a second language, I e achievement beliefs
Task knowledge has three facets It refers to what learners know about the
purpose of a task and how it will serve their language learning needs, e g to
improve their writing skills, expand their vocabulary , develop fluency in oral
communication It also includes knowledge that is the outcome of a
classification process that determines the nature of a particular task— This
may mean understanding-that learning to read is different from learning to
write or being able to distinguish a creative thinking task from a problem
solving task Finally, task knowledge includes information about a task's
demands, l e how to learn in general, how to go about doing a particular task,
and the knowledge and skills needed to do so (See Wenden 1986, Horwitz
1987, 1988, Holec 1987, Benson 1990, Victon 1995, Cotterall 1995, Mon
1997 for research on the task knowledge of FL/SL learners)
Task knowledge should be distinguished from domain knowledge, which is
utilized to determine the (task) knowledge that will guide the completion of a
particular task Domain knowledge refers to what the learner knows about the

Metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive strategies
As noted in Brown et al (1983), metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive
strategies are two separate and distinct components of the broader notion of
metacogmtion Therefore they should not be considered interchangeable or
similar Metacognitive knowledge refers to information learners acquire about
their learning, while metacognitive strategies are general skills through which
learners manage, direct, regulate, guide their learning, i e planning,
monitonng and evaluating 6 The deployment of these three strategies in
learning is referred to as self-regulation in cognitive psychology and as selfdirection in adult education and in the literature on learner autonomy in FL/
SL learning Because the literature that forms the basis for the analysis that
follows is drawn from cognitive psychology, the term self-regulation will be
used in this next section of the article 7

subject matter of the learning, 1 e conceptual and factual knowledge It also
includes knowledge about the manner in which this information is
communicated, 1 e the structure of the discourse used to organize it For
example, to do a legal analysis, learners must utilize knowledge of the law and
of text type, 1 e of different kinds of cases (Lundeberg 1987) In the case of
mathematics, knowledge of measurement, number concepts, and arithmetic
problem solving schemata are examples of domain specific knowledge {Glaser
1984) Knowledge of vocabulary and world/content background knowledge
are examples of domain knowledge FL/SL learners need for fluent reading
(Grabe 1991)
Strategic knowledge refers to general knowledge about what strategies are,
why they are useful, and specific knowledge about when and how to use
them In fact, it may be logically viewed as a subset of task knowledge
However, following Flavell (1979, 1981, 1981a), we include it as a separate
classification because of the unique role it plays in the processing (rather than
the planning) of learning There is now a respectable body of research which
has documented the learning strategies of foreign and second language
learners, l e what they do to help themselves leam (e g Rubin 1975, Naunan,
Frohlich, Stem and Todesco 1978, Cohen 1990, Hosenfeld 1984, Pohtzer and
McGroarty 1985, Abraham and Vann 1987, Chamot 1987, O'Malley and
Chamot 1990, Oxford 1996) However, in some cases, l e the research that
utilizes data collecting techniques, such as interviews and questionnaires,
which lead learners to retrospect upon their learning, is, in fact, requiring
them to draw upon their stored metacogmtive knowledge about learning
strategies Thus, the resulting accounts-of strategies learners may actually use
or think they use or should use- can also be viewed as evidence of their
strategic knowledge

METACOGNITIVE KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING

Planning and evaluating
The metacognitive knowledge learners have acquired about themselves as
learners (i e their person knowledge) has been shown to influence their
choice of learning objectives and the cntena they use for evaluating learning
outcomes In their research, Zimmerman and Bandura (1994) have
considered the influence of beliefs learners hold about their ability to mobilize
and direct resources for learning and to sustain this effort (I e self-efficacy
beliefs) and to master a particular academic subject, e g history, or to acquire
particular skills, e g computer programming or wnting (I e achievement

According to Flavell (1979), metacognitive knowledge plays an important role
in many cognitive activities related to language use, e g oral communication
of information, oral persuasion, oral comprehension, reading comprehension,
and writing, to language acquisition, and to vanous types of self-instruction It
is activated deliberately when the nature of the learning task requires
conscious thinking and accuracy, when the task is new, or when learning
has not been correct or complete However, it may appear automatically,
evoked by retrieval cues in the task situation, and finally, 'it may and probably
does influence the course of the cognitive enterpnse without itself entenng
into consciousness' (Flavell 1979 907-8)
The literature reviewed notes that metacognitive knowledge charactenzes
the approach of expert learners to learning (Baker and Brown 1984,
Nickerson et al 1985, Wong 1986, Garner 1987), it enhances learning
outcomes (Dickinson 1995, Zimmerman 1989, Zimmerman and Bahdura
1994), facilitating recall (Flavell as cited in Nickerson et al 1985), the
comprehension, of wntten texts (Brown et al 1986, Schommer 1990,
Schommer et al 1992), the completion of new types of learning tasks
(Vann and Abraham 1990), it improves the rate of progress in learning
(Victori and Lockart 1995), and the quality and speed of learners' cognitive
engagement (Pintnch et al 1993)
Of special relevance, however, is the influence of metacognitive knowledge
in the self-regulation of learning, l e in planning, momtonng and evaluating
According to the literature, it is a prerequisite to self-regulation (e g Butler
and Winne 1995, Baker and Brown 1984), helping learners to become 'active
participants in their own performance rather than passive recipients of
instruction
' (Pans and Winograd 1990 18) and providing the knowledge
base for effective planning, momtonng and evaluating (Perkins and Salomon
1989) More specifically, the review has shown how metacognitive knowledge influences planning, evaluating and momtonng in the self:regulation of
learning In addition,,it has brought to light the role of this knowledge in task
analysis and learning transfer, two processes implicit in the planning and
momtonng of learning that have, heretofore, been ignored

beliefs) They hypothesize that the stronger the learners' self-efficacy beliefs,
the more challenging their learning goals will be and the more intensely they
will seek to overcome obstacles faced in the course of learning Their causal
model of self-regulation in writing (Figure 1) explains how this hypothesis is
reflected in the manner in which learners regulate their attempts to master
academic writing, 1 e select learning goals and evaluation criteria
As illustrated in Figure 1, learners who believe they can regulate their
writing and maintain their efforts to do so (self-regulatory efficacy for writing,
I e self-efficacy beliefs) will be inclined to believe they can learn to write (selfefficacy for academic achievement, l e achievement beliefs) and set stnngent
evaluative criteria for themselves {self-evaluative standards) This, in turn,
leads them to aim for high grades {grade goals) Learning outcomes (their final
grades), according to the model, are directly related to these last three factors,
I e their achievement beliefs, evaluation criteria, learning goals, and
indirectly related to their beliefs about self-efficacy (see Groteluschen et al
1990 for similar views, and Zimmerman and Bandura 1994 for the results of a
study which supports the assumptions made by the model)
While Zimmerman and Bandura (1994) focused on the level of achievement reflected in the learning goals of undergraduate students, Boekaerts
(1992) makes explicit the manner in which metacognitive knowledge is
brought to bear upon the kind of goals younger students set in response to a
task
According to her model of the affective learning process, when a classroom
teacher assigns a task, the learners' perception of the task's demands triggers

522 METACOGNITIVE KNOWLEDGE AND LANGUAGE LEARNING

an appraisal process that is based on two categories of metacogmtive
knowledge
(1) what they know about themselves as'learners {person knowledge)—
whether they possess the knowledge and skills necessary to do the task,
whether they are competent as learners
(2) their perception of the task's purpose (task knowledge)—whether it is
compatible with their goals
Downloaded from http://applij.oxfordjournals.org/ at Pennsylvania State University on March 4, 2016

If learners determine that they have the skills and the competence to do the
task and if they consider that the task's purpose will serve their learning goals,
they will choose learning oriented goals, I e goals that will enable them to
expand their knowledge or gain new skills On the other hand, if the appraisal
is negative, learners may choose coping onented goals, I e they try to
minimize the discomfort resulting from their lack of skill, or choose to avoid
the task completely For example, assuming a teacher has asked learners to
complete and hand in a set of questions based, on a chapter in their science
text, learners whose task appraisal has been positive may choose to outline
the reading upon which the questions are based, seeking not just to get the
questions answered but to understand the material In contrast, learners who
believe they have difficulty with science or who consider themselves poor
readers may decide to ask their fnends for the answers
The criteria by which learning outcomes are evaluated, Boekaerts (1992)
notes, are influenced by a learner's goals Learning-onented goals are
evaluated according to learning outcomes Learners who deeded to outline
the reading will determine they have been successful if they understand the
questions and can answer them However, the others, who approached the
task differently, may be pleased because they receive a good grade or, simply,
the teacher's approval for handing in the questions, in this case, the criteria
for determining success being external (See Volet 1991 for similar findings
based on her research on college students)
The L2 learner strategy research has also begun to document the
relationship between metacogmtive knowledge, specifically task knowledge,
and planning and evaluating In his study Holec (1987) reports on the
relationship between the change in learners' beliefs about language learning
and the manner in which they planned their learning Thus, at the outset of a
self-directed learning project, planning decisions were limited to the choice of
proper materials, but as learners' understanding of the learning process and
their role in it changed, their planning decisions expanded to the selection of
learning activities and the setting of objectives Wenden's (1987a) study of L2
learners' theories about language learning includes three case studies which
illustrate how these beliefs affected the priorities the learners set, their choice
of strategies and their criteria for evaluating their learning Learners who
believed using the language was the key to successful learning emphasized the
need to learn to speak, selected practice strategies, and evaluated positively
situations which provided an opportunity for oral communication In his case

ANITA L WENDEN 523

study of how an L2 student coped with the listening and note-taking demands
of regular college classes, Benson (1990) found that the student's approach to
academic listening and note taking (e g trying to note down what he felt the
teacher wanted) was influenced by his conception of learning as a
reproductive process Finally, based on sociocultural theory, Gillette's study
(1994) concludes that learners' views on the value of second language study
shaped their goals and, indirectly, determined their approach—the degree of
effort made and the kinds of learning activities selected

An essential component of efficient planning, task analysis refers to three sets
of considerations learners engage in at the outset of learning to understand an
assigned or self-set task and to determine how to approach it That is, they must
determine what they are expected to leam from the task and compare this with
their learning needs and goals, l e consider task purpose (Breen 1987) They
must also classify the task—identify the nature of the problem it poses and
consider whether it is similar to one they've already done (Pans and Bymes
1989, Resnick 1989) Finally, they must assess a task's demands—consider how
to best approach the task and the knowledge and skills they will need to do so
(Glaser 1984, Groteleschuen et al 1990, de Jong and Simons 1992) 8
To illustrate, let us consider the task analysis conducted by a hypothetical
language learner of English who is taking a course in wnting for foreign
students
The teacher asks the class to read an article on global warming and to
summarize it Since this is a wnting course, the learner wonders why
he should read this article and how wnting a summary will enable him
to write the argumentative essay that is necessary to pass the course
Still, he continues with the task He notes that this is an article on global
warming and realizes this is a topic with which he is not familiar
Further noting that he is expected to summarize it, he recalls that texts
dealing with social problems often refer to the consequences of these
problems and assumes these consequences would represent the key
ideas he is asked to summarize He, therefore, decides to read to identify
the effects of global warming At the same time, concluding that an
article on global warming must be a scientific article and that it will,
therefore, contain unfamiliar technical terms, he also decides to make a
list of these terms as he encounters them Having made his plan, he
feels that while the task may be tedious (he does not like scientific
articles), it should not be too difficult
Our learner begins by considering the task's purpose, questioning its
relevance It may be assumed that the task does not conform to his
beliefs of how one should learn to write
His discourse knowledge of expository texts, evoked by the term 'global
warming' in the task statement, is the basis for his classification of the
reading as a (1) scientific text (2) about social problems.

Task analysis

524 METACOGNTTIVE KNOWLEDGE AND LANGUAGE LEARNING

His discourse knowledge is also used to assess the task's demands
The task requirement, that he write a summary, evokes his knowledge
of summaries, 1 e they are based on the key ideas of a reading. His
knowledge about expository texts dealing with soaal problems leads him to

Finally, his understanding of the task gained by this analysis leads him to

conclude that the task will not be difficult.
The illustration suggests that all three kinds of metacognitive knowledge
can come into play at this critical juncture in learning Task knowledge is
what prompts learners to inmate a task analysis to realize that it needs to be
done It also dictates what must be done to complete the task, 1 e consider the
task's purpose, its demands and how to classify it Person knowledge enables
learners to recognize what they know and what they don't know (the learner
was not familiar with the topic of the reading nor with technical terms that
might be used to talk about global warming), what they like and what they
don't like {he found scientific articles tedious) and strategic knowledge guides
them in selecting strategies to deal with anticipated difficulties (he chose list
making to deal with technical terms)
The illustration further suggests that domain knowledge is also necessary to
completing a task analysis As noted earlier, domain knowledge refers to what
the learner knows about the subject matter of the learning and the nature of
the discourse through which this information is communicated In fact, our
hypothetical learner recognized that he knew very little about global
warming, the subject matter of the article, but he does use his discourse
knowledge to determine the task's demands His knowledge of summaries and
of expository texts about soaal problems leads him to conclude that he is
expected to find main ideas and that these should be the effects of global
warming His knowledge of scientific articles further leads him to anticipate
the need to understand technical terms Thus, both metacognitive and
domain knowledge are essential for learners to construct an accurate
understanding of a particular task and it is this newly acquired (task)
knowledge, which, then, guides and informs the manner in which they plan
their learning, i e make decisions about how to proceed (See De Groot, Chi,
Mayer, Linn, cited in Bransford and Vye 1989, Voss et at 1983, Glaser 1984,
Schoenfeld and Herman 1982, Rohwer and Thomas 1989 on the importance
of domain knowledge, and Bransford et al 1981, Nickerson et al 1985, Brown
et al 1983, Perkins 1986 on the importance of metacognitive knowledge )

expect that the article will describe the effects of these problems and
so to conclude that these must be the key ideas that have to be found
in order to write the summary His knowledge about scientific articles
leads him to anticipate the use of technical terms and the need to
understand them.
The learner's person knowledge is the basis for his realization that he
is not familiar with this topic and that he does not like scientific
articles. He uses his knowledge of strategies to choose list making as a
means of dealing with unfamiliar technical terms he expects to find.

Monitonng
Bnefly defined, monitoring consists of keeping track of how the learning
process is going and taking appropriate measures to deal with difficulties that
interfere with the process (Flavell 1981 272) Implicit in this description is an
assessment of the cause of perceived difficulties Metacognitive knowledge is
noted to be necessary to the monitonng process {Markman 1981) To
illustrate, let us further consider the learner who has been asked to read
the article on global warming

The illustration points to four ways, described in the literature, in which
metacognitive knowledge plays a role in the monitonng process First of all, it
is what constitutes the internal feedback, I e the state of awareness, which
reveals how well learning is proceeding or can be expected to proceed (Butler
and Winne 1995, Corno and Kanfer 1993, Howard-Rose and Winne and
Zimmerman as cited in Butler and Winne 1995, Flavell 1979, 1981a) In the
illustration, the learner becomes aware of the fact that he cannot find any
effects of global warming in the reading, that the reading is harder than
anticipated, and that list making is not useful 9 Secondly, metacognitive
knowledge may be the basis.for this internal assessment of comprehension
(Brown et al 1983, Baker 1985, Weinstein and Rogers 1985) and/or of
progress towards a goal (Pans and Myers 1981, Wong 1986, Brown et al 1983,
Carver and Scheier 1990, Kitchner 1983) Thus, implicit in the hypothetical
learner's recognition that he cannot discover the effects of global warming is
his earlier assessment of the task's demands which had led him to conclude
that this was the information he must find to wnte the summary Similarly, it
is his earlier assessment about his ability to do the task <i e that it would be
easy) which leads to the awareness that it is harder than he had anticipated
Thirdly, metacognitive knowledge may suggest the reason for the problems
revealed through this state of awareness As illustrated above, the learner
remembers he has never been good at science Finally, learners' acquired
metacognitive knowledge and beliefs can also be drawn upon to guide their
decision making during this phase of the monitonng process They must
decide how to respond to this internal feedback whether or not to maintain,
revise, or reject earlier choices, whether to make new ones (e g Wellman
1985, Butler and Winne 1995, Corno and Kanfer 1993, Kitchener 1983,
Flavell 1981a, Chinn and Brewer 1993, Pans and Myers 1981, Pans and

Downloaded from http://applij.oxfordjournals.org/ at Pennsylvania State University on March 4, 2016

Halfway through the task, he realizes that he has not really been able
to find any effects of global warming in the reading, the main ideas he
needs to wnte a summary Moreover, he feels the article is harder than
he had anticipated He remembers that he was never good at science
and concludes this must be the reason Moreover, he finds list making
is not very useful and so discontinues the use of this strategy However,
motivated by a general belief that one must persist even in the face of
difficulty, he chooses to read each paragraph very slowly and to use
contextual cues to infer the meaning of unknown terms

526 METACOGNITIVE KNOWLEDGE AND LANGUAGE LEARNING

Transfer of learning
Transfer of learning refers to the application of acquired knowledge and skills
used in a previous task to the completion of a present task When a learner
who has learned how to guess from context while reading applies the same
strategy to the comprehension of oral communication, learning is being
transferred Learning transfer can take place at the outset of learning, as
learners plan how best to complete a task, it can also occur while they
monitor the implementation of their plan In learning transfer, metacognitive
knowledge facilitates the appropriate choice of previously learned strategies to
achieve learning goals and/or to deal with problems encountered during the
learning The literature presents two views on the kind of metacognitive
knowledge that is necessary to this process the motivational view and the
methodological view
Motivational view According to this view, person and strategic knowledge
are necessary for transfer It is assumed that
(1) Learners who approach a particular learning task will have acquired an
understanding of a range of strategies that may be used to do it—task
specific strategy knowledge
(2) They understand that effort is required to apply strategies and that wellchosen strategies may improve performance—general strategy knowledge
(3) Finally, they hold beliefs about their ability to control their learning, l e
that success is the result of their efforts and not of an uncontrollable
factor—person knowledge about self-efficacy
According to Groteluschen et al (1990), the strategies learners choose to do
a task will be based on their specific strategy knowledge If a chosen strategy is

Byrnes 1989, Schommer 1990) The hypothetical learner decided to use a new
strategy, drawing upon his strategic knowledge, and to persist even though it
was hard, drawing upon his self-efficacy beliefs (I e person knowledge)
Monitoring can also lead learners to refine and expand their metacognitive
knowledge (Wellman 1985, Zimmerman 1989, Butler and Winne 1995, Pans
and Winograd 1990) As they monitor, they are prompted to examine the
relationships among learning goals, means of achieving them, task outcomes
and to accommodate their knowledge to what has been observed (Flavell
1979, 1981) Thus, realizing that list making (the means) which he had
selected to facilitate understanding of technical terms (learning goal) was not
helping him to understand (learning outcome), the hypothetical learner
discontinued its use having learned that it was not an effective strategy
(revision of strategic knowledge) Thus, in the case of monitoring, the
relationship with metacognitive knowledge is reciprocal On the one hand, it
is the basis for monitoring and, on the other, the knowledge generated by
monitoring can be used to revise the learners' existing knowledge base

effective and learners feel it has unproved the quality of their learning, their
specific strategy knowledge is strengthened Additionally, the realization that
a particular strategy can be effective will strengthen their belief about the
effectiveness of strategies, 1 e general strategy knowledge, which, in turn, will
strengthen their self-efficacy beliefs The learner will be more convinced that
they can exercise control over their learning, thus reciprocally reinforcing
their general strategy knowledge These reinforced beliefs about strategy use
and self-efficacy, it is implied, will, then, make it more likely that learners will
use strategies and, therefore, choose the successful strategy in another context
when appropriate
Returning once again to the hypothetical learner, let us assume his decision
to try to infer the meaning of unknown terms rather than make lists enabled
him to comprehend a fair number of words He may, then, conclude that
inferencing is a useful strategy and further realize that strategies can help him
understand better as well as give him some control over his learning
Therefore, the following week, when, once again, he is asked to read a text
with many unfamiliar terms, he selects inferencing as the strategy he will use
to comprehend these terms In other words, it is assumed that the effective
use of a strategy can expand learners' strategic knowledge and/or re-enforce
what they already know, thus motivating them to use strategies and,
therefore, to transfer effective strategies to other contexts as needed
(Groteluschen et al 1990, see Borkowski et al 1992 for similar views)
Methodological view On the other hand, according to the methodological
view, strategic and task knowledge are necessary for the transfer of learned
strategies and strategy instruction is the means of providing it To that end, it
is recommended that strategy instruction (1) be informed {Brown and
Palmscar 1982, Brown et al 1983, Baker and Brown 1984), (2) provide
conditional knowledge (Pans, Newman, and McVey as cited in Pans and
Byrnes 1989) and (3) promote mindfulness (Wong 1991) Informed training
provides knowledge about the purpose of the strategy—what the expected
outcome of using it will be Training provides conditional knowledge if it tells
learners when a strategy can be used so that it is likely that they will use it not
only in the training context but in a vanety of other appropnate settings
Finally, mindfulness is promoted when learners are taught to determine
whether there are similarities between previous learning activities {or tasks)
and the present task The task knowledge yielded by this comparison will,
then, be the basis for determining whether the strategy applicable to a former
task can be transferred in the present case (see Carrell 1989, Wenden 1991,
Chamot and O'Malley 1993, Ellis and Sinclair 1989 for similar views on
strategy instruction in FL/SL) To restate, when strategy instruction meets
these three cntena, it is expected that learners will have acquired the strategic
and task knowledge that will lead to the transfer of a learned strategy to a
similar context

528 METACOGNITIVE KNOWLEDGE AND LANGUAGE LEARNING

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FINDINGS

Learner strategy resc^ch and instruction
By descnbing how metacogmtive knowledge functions in the self-regulation
of learning, the review provides insights on the use of cognitive strategies in
language learning At the same time, it points to an area of research needed
for a better understanding of this aspect of self-regulation That is, most of the
strategy research, thus far, has focused on documenting the learning strategies
of successful learners, to a lesser degree, it has also sought to identify which

Downloaded from http://applij.oxfordjournals.org/ at Pennsylvania State University on March 4, 2016

This article has reported on a review of selected theoretical writings and
research reports which aimed to determine the function of metacogmtive
knowledge in learning The review has shown that metacognitive knowledge
is a prerequisite for the self-regulation of learning it informs planning
decisions taken at the outset of learning and the monitoring processes that
regulate the completion of a learning task, 1 e self-observation, assessment of
problems and progress, and decisions to remediate, it also provides the criteria
for evaluation made once a learning task is completed In addition, the review
has shown that in some aspects of planning, 1 e the procedures that constitute
task analysis, metacogmtive knowledge is insufficient Domain knowledge
plays an essential and complementary role Finally, the review has pointed to
the distinct functions of metacogmtive knowledge On the one hand, it is
motivational—energizing the processes of self-regulation—while on the other,
it is cognitively oriented—shaping and guiding these same processes Thus,
the findings support the practice-based intuition of FL/SL language
researchers and teachers who implicitly recognize the importance of
knowledge about learning when they advocate that it be included in tasks
that aim to help language learners learn how to learn
In addition , the insights about the function of metacogmtive knowledge in
learning provided by the review should enhance our understanding of three
theoretically distinct views of second language acquisition and learning, each
of which give the learner an active role in the learning process, namely
learner strategies research and instruction, self-directed language learning,
and sociocultural theory Learner strategies research and instruction is based
on cognitive theory (cf O'Malley and Chamot 1990), while the theory
underlying self-directed language learning is drawn from insights proposed in
theoretical writings in adult learning and development {cf Holec 1981,
Wenden 1987) Finally, Vygotskian perspectives of cognitive functioning and
development provide the foundation for sociocultural theory {cf Donato and
McCormick 1994, Lantolf and Appel 1994) Each of these approaches focuses
on regulation in language learning though their descriptions of its origin,
processes and/or scope vary In addition, in their writings, the role of
knowledge is either implied or bnefly referred to, but it is not exphatly linked
to self-regulation

ANITA L WENDEN 529

Self-directed language learning
Theoretical wntings about self-instruction (eg Dickinson 1987). and selfdirection in language learning {eg Holec 1981) have identified planning,
monitonng and evaluating as the skills that constitute self-directed language
learning, and the literature in this field has concentrated on better understanding each skill It has specified the range of decisions that define planning
e g clarifying needs, goal setting, prioritizing goals, setting objectives, defining
content and progression
(eg Holec 1981, Carver 1984, Holec 1985a,
Huttunen 1986, Dickinson 1987, Oxford 1990, Cotterall 1995, MuellerVerweyen 1995, Rubin 1995, Wenden 1991a, Kelly 1996, Thomson 1996)
Initial attempts have been made to define the procedures and scope of
monitonng (Rubin 1987, Oxford 1990, Enksson 1993, Chamot and O'Malley
1994, Wenden 1991, Little 1991, Thomson 1996), and the processes and focus
of evaluation have been delineated (eg Wenden 1991, Holec 1985a,
Huttunen 1986, Little 1991, O'Malley and Chamot 1990, Westhoff 1993,
Thomson 1996) However, as noted at the beginning of this article, there has
been no attempt to delineate the function of metacognitive knowledge in
planning, monitonng, and evaluating This review has provided for this lack
illustrating and explaining how metacognitive knowledge comes into play in

cognitive strategies may be used in the completion of specific learning tasks,
e g finding the main idea, gap filling, and more broadly, in the execution of
the different language skills, primarily reading and listening (e g Chamot
1987, O'Malley and Chamot 1990, Oxford 1990, Cohen 1990) However, as
reflected by the very few studies cited in this survey, learner strategy research
which has documented the link between learners' acquired metacognitive
knowledge and the use of strategies is scant To restate, then, the survey
expands our theoretical understanding of strategy use and points to an area
that should be included as part of the learner strategy research agenda
Furthermore, the discussion of the role of metacognitive knowledge in the
transfer of learning confirms and refines insights that have shaped FL/SL
cognitive strategy instruction In contrast to the research on learner
strategies, the literature. that describes procedures for cognitive strategy
instruction does recognize the importance of strategic knowledge, advising
teachers to provide learners with knowledge about the utility of strategies
and the conditions appropnate for their use (e g O'Malley and Chamot 1990,
Hosenfeld 1981, Oxford 1990) The discussion of both the motivational and
methodological views on the transfer of learning, which demonstrates that it
is the possession of strategic knowledge which leads learners to use particular
strategies, confirms the appropriateness of this methodological approach At
the same time, it (the discussion) provides insights that should refine it, l e
about the need for person knowledge to motivate learners to continue to use
strategies and the key role of task knowledge in the transfer of learned
strategies

530 METACOGNTTIVE KNOWLEDGE AND LANGUAGE LEARNING

the execution of these three skills for self-directed learning, including task
analysis, a planning skill that had, heretofore, been ignored This is
information that can enhance both the research and instruction in this
area, signaling the need {1) to investigate the role of metacognitive knowledge
in the use of self-directed learning skills and (2) to incorporate metacognitive
knowledge in tasks that aim to help learners self-direct their learning

Based on the work of Vygotsky, sociocultural theory views the social setting as
the primary and determining factor in the development of higher order
mental functioning (Lantolf and Appel 1994 1-32) Activity theory, which
expands upon some of the themes introduced by Vygotsky, aims to clanfy
what the individual or group is doing in a particular setting, and activity, one
of the three concepts that explains the theory, is defined 'as a socially
determined setting, based on a set of assumptions about roles, goals, and
means to be used by a participant in that setting' (Lantolf and Appel op at
16) In other words, according to the definition, action which flows from a
setting must be understood in terms of the goals, role and means that define it
(i e the setting) However, it is the socially acquired assumptions, I e beliefs
or knowledge, built into the setting and which may emerge through the
interaction that takes place in it, which shape these components of a setting
Thus, the definition appears to recognize the role of beliefs/knowledge in
motivating human action, including, one may assume, the self-regulation of
learning However, it is the setting or activity, including the effect of its
interactional dimension, which some researchers choose to emphasize as the
factor that shapes regulatory activity (cf, for example, Gillette 1994,
Coughlan and Duff 1994) In these studies the knowledge/beliefs embedded
in the setting or which emerge through the interaction that takes place in it is
overlooked as a source of insight on learner's motives, goals and operations
This review, on the role of metacognitive knowledge in the self-regulation of
learning, highlights this variable that appears to be ignored and undeveloped
in sociocultural theory

CONCLUSION
The preceding section has indicated, very generally, how insights yielded by
the review can be used by those FL/SL teachers who make the provision of
learner training an integral part of their language instruction The conclusion,
therefore, will outline two general suggestions to illustrate the practical
implications of the survey for extending the role of all FL/SL teachers in this
manner
(I) The review suggests that teachers should try to gain an undemanding of their
learners' beliefs and acquired knowledge about language learning In other words,

just as they will usually diagnose their students' level of linguistic proficiency

(1) ehcitatwn of learners' metacogmtive knowledge and beliefs
(2) articulation of what has come to awareness
(3) confrontation with alternative views
(4) reflection on the appropriateness of revising, expanding one's knowledge
Thus, such tasks and materials should provide learners with an opportunity
to acquire new concepts about language learning They should be encouraged
to use these 'new' ideas to seek insights into how they learn and into the
reasons for unsuccessful learning outcomes They can also^be shown how
some of these ideas can be applied to the development of solutions to learning
problems Then, as their understanding of their language learning process is
broadened, they can begin to use these new insights to expenment with
different approaches to learning without guidance, I e autonomously—
drawing upon solutions and knowledge that have been validated and looking
critically at or even discarding what has not What will be significant, then, is
that it is the learners who will be making the final decisions regarding how to
learn more efficiently and how best to improve their learning outcomes "

at the outset of a language course, they should also assess their knowledge
and beliefs about language learning Through the use of surveys, oral
interviews, and focus groups, they can develop a profile of the metacognmve
knowledge of their students Depending on the questions that have been
asked, they may determine how learners perceive the course content, e g
writing, reading, grammar, tasks that are typically assigned their role in
learning, or why some learners are actively and independently involved in
their learning while others do not appear to take any initiative at all In
addition, such information may be gathered dunng the course of learning, as
needed Learners' views on problematic tasks or irremediable language
problems can be sought to seek insight on specific difficulties experienced
by a class as a group or by individual learners 10
(2) Teachers should also aim to help language learners develop a more reflective and
self-directed approach to learning their new language For the greater part,
language instructors will view their goal as the provision of instruction that
facilitates the development of linguistic autonomy However, this research
suggests that learners also need guidance in improving and expanding their
knowledge about learning so that they may also become more autonomous in
their approach to the learning of their new language The following four
procedures that define awareness raising activities for (metacogmtive)
knowledge acquisition may be used as a guide in devising tasks and materials
for this purpose (cf Wenden 1997 for a more detailed description of each
step), l e

NOTES
a discussion of this perspective is not
included in this survey because it is predicated on a distinct metaphorical understanding of mental activity and emphasizes
the role of external/social factors in the
development and exercise of self-regulation, in contrast to the internal ones, such
as metacogmtive knowledge At the same
time, a few studies based on this perspective
were included in the review as their data
and/or conclusions appeared to be relevant
to the topic under discussion (i e Gillette
1994 and Platt and Brooks 1994)
8 Task analysis appears to be similar to what
is referred to as orientation by Vygotsky
(see Appel and Lantolf 1994 443 for a
descnption of what this latter notion entails
and situation definition by Wertsch, cited in
Platt and Brooks 1994 505)
9 See Platt and Brooks (1994 506-7), a study
based on sociocultural theory, which
includes learner narratives to show how
speech is used to regulate learning In fact,
some of these accounts can also serve to
illustrate how metacogmtive knowledge, in
this instance as awareness of problems that
impede progress, can emerge as learners
monitor the completion of a language
learning task, cf 8—awareness of not
being clear about the task purpose, 9—of
frustration, and 10—of not understanding
what has been said
10 See Wenden 1991 and Oxford 1990 for
different approaches to collecting data on
students' learning processes and Wenden
1991 for a guide to analyzing and interpreting the data

approaches to the development of tasks
and materials that go beyond simple awareness raising to help learners reflect upon
and expand their metacogmtive knowledge,

Dochy's (1995) study of how adults distinguish between knowledge and beliefs They
surveyed 120 adults—undergraduate .and
graduate students in the United States and
Europe (primarily the Netherlands) and
experts in the area of knowledge and
beliefs
5 Since beliefs are understood to be a component of metacogmtive knowledge, the
latter term is sometimes used to refer both
to knowledge and beliefs in the discussion
that follows
6 The self-regulatory skills listed in the
cognitive literature are quite varied, but in
this article they will be referred to as
planning, monitoring and evaluating,
based on Brown et al (1983), whose
seminal writings served to distinguish
between knowledge about learning (metacognitive knowledge) and the regulation of
learning (metacogmtive strategies) In addition it is these three strategies that have
been adopted for language learning in
O'Malley and Chamot's (1990) taxonomy
of language learning strategies
7 It should be noted that self-regulation is
also key to the view of language learning
proposed by sociocultural theory However
